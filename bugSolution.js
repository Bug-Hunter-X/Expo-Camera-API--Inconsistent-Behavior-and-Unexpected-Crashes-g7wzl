To mitigate this bug, implement thorough error handling and consider device-specific adjustments.  Check for permissions, handle asynchronous operations gracefully, and include fallback mechanisms.  Implement checks for device capabilities before attempting certain camera features. 

Example:
```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  // ... (previous code)

  const takePicture = async () => {
    try {
      let photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
      console.log(photo);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Camera error:', error);
      // Handle the error gracefully, showing an alert or fallback UI
    }
  };

  return (
    <Camera style={styles.camera} type={type} ref={cameraRef}>
      <Button title="Take Picture" onPress={takePicture} />
    </Camera>
  );
};
```
This improved example includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during picture capture, offering a more robust solution.
